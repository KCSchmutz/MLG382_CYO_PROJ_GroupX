 - [x] __Choose a Project:__ Inventory management
 - [x] __Research Relevant Datasets:__
 Begin by searching for datasets relevant to your 
 chosen project from public sources such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning 
 Repository, or government databases. Look for datasets that include the necessary 
 features and target variables for training your ML model.
 - [x] ## Data Exploration and Pre-processing:
 - [x] __Data Exploration and Pre-processing:__
 Once you have obtained a suitable dataset, 
 perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand its structure, distributions, and 
 relationships between variables. Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, 
 and inconsistencies. Perform pre-processing steps such as feature scaling, encoding 
 categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

 - [x] ## Develop ML Model(s):
 - [x] __Develop ML Model(s):__
 Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms and 
 techniques based on the nature of your project (e.g., classification, regression, 
 clustering). Train and evaluate multiple models using cross-validation and hyper
 parameter tuning to identify the best-performing model(s) for your dataset.

 - [ ] ## Build a Web Application with DASH:
 - [ ] __Build a Web Application with DASH:__
 Utilize the DASH framework to develop a web 
 application that integrates your trained ML model(s). Create an intuitive user interface 
 with interactive components for user input and model predictions. Use HTML, CSS, 
 and JavaScript to customize the design and layout of your web application.
 - [ ] ## Implement Model Deployment:
 - [ ] __Implement Model Deployment:__
 Deploy your web application and ML model(s) as a 
 web service using a platform like Render. Follow the platform's documentation and 
 guidelines to set up the deployment environment, configure dependencies, and deploy 
 your application to a live server.

 - [x] ## Testing and Validation:
 - [x] __Testing and Validation:__
 Test your web application thoroughly to ensure that it 
 functions as intended and provides accurate predictions based on user input. Validate 
 the performance of your deployed ML model(s) by comparing predictions with ground 
 truth labels or expected outcomes.
 - [x] ## Documentation and Presentation:
 - [x] __Documentation and Presentation:__
 Document your project thoroughly, including 
 details of the dataset, ML model(s), web application development process, and 
 deployment steps. Prepare a presentation to showcase your project, highlighting key 
 findings, challenges faced, and lessons learned.

 - [ ] ## Continuous Improvement:
 - [ ] __Continuous Improvement:__
 Seek feedback from peers, instructors, and users to 
 identify areas for improvement in your project. Iterate on your web application and ML 
 model(s) based on feedback and new insights gained during the development and 
 deployment process.
 - [ ] ## Reflection and Future Work:
 - [ ] __Reflection and Future Work:__
 Reflect on your project experience and consider future 
 enhancements or extensions to further enhance the functionality and performance of 
 your web application and ML model(s). Document any ideas for future research or
